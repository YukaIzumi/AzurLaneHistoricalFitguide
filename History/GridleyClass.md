### Overview

This group of treaty destroyers moutned 4 5"38 dual-purpose guns and 16 21" torpedo tubes in 4 mounts. A weak anti-aircraft armament limited their surface to air combat, but all 4 ships managed to survive the war. Additionally, these ships had an improved propulsion system, enabling the fastest trial speed on record (at the time) on USS Maury, at 42.8 knots.

The ships were crewed by 8 officers and 150-250 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

This class was restricted by the Second Washington Naval Treaty. These ships displaced 1590 tons standard and 2219 tons under full load. Propulsion was supplied by 4 Yarrow boilers supplying 2 Bethlehem Parsons-type geared steam turbines, for a total output of 47,000 shaft horsepower. These ships were capable of a sustained 38.5 knots and had a cruising range of up to 5520 nautical miles.
