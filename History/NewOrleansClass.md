### Overview

The New Orleans Class of Heavy Cruisers were introduced to the Fleet between 1930 and 1934. All ships saw combat, 3 of which were sunk in the Battle of Savo Island, the other 4 were struck from the registry in 1959. These were among the hardest fighting ships in WWII, taking part in all of the large combat exercises throughout the war. These were the last "Treaty Era" heavy cruisers produced by the united states.  <br/>

The ships were crewed by 708 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

The last heavy cruisers of the Washington Naval Treaty era, the New Orleans class of cruisers were made to make the most of the strict limitations. At full load, these ships displaced roughly 10,000 tons (12,500 tons fully loaded). Propulsion was supplied by 8 Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers producing 107,000 horsepower to 4 Westinghouse geared steam turbines. These turbines turned four screws, permitting a rated speed of 32.75 knots and a range of 9,000 nautical miles.
