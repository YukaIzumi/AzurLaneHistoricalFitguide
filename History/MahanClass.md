### Overview

Improved versions of the Farragut class, these ships managed to combine an armament of 12 21" torpedo tubes and 5 5" dual-purpose gun mounts. New machinery enabled higher pressure and temperature with a lighter overall framing. These ships also contained some of the first cruising turbines in the US Navy.

The ships were crewed by 250 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

This class was restricted by the Second Washington Naval Treaty. These ships displaced 1524 tons standard, 2137 tons full load. Propulsion was supplied by 4 Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving 2 General Electric steam turbines, for a total output of 46,000 shaft horsepower. These ships were capable of 37 knots and had a cruising range of up to 6940 nautical miles.
