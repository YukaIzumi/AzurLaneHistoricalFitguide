### Overview

Introduced in the 1910s, the Queen Elizabeth class dreadnoughts paired existing designs from the Iron Duke class with improved armaments, defenses, and maneuverability. These were the first battleships in the Royal Navy (perhaps the World) armed with a 15" main battery. Some ships received retrofits in their later years, augmenting their anti-aircraft armament and sensor equipment.

The ships were crewed by 950 enlisted men, or 1200 men as a flagship. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Under full load, the Queen Elizabeth class boasted a weight of 33,260 tons. A maximum armor thickness of 12 inches was in place along the belt. Propulsion was managed by 24 Babcock & Wilcox boilers (Yarrow boilers in Warspite and Barham) powering two direct-drive steam turbines, manufactured by either Parsons (Queen Elizabeth, Warspite, and Malaya) or Brown-Curtis (Barham and Valiant), turning 3 propellers. Resulting shaft horsepower was measured at 75,000. This permitted a speed up to 23.9 knots. <br/>
