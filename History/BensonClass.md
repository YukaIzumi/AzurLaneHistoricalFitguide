### Overview

The Benson class of destroyers debuted in 1940, participating heavily in pre-war "Neutrality Patrols", going on to fight in every campaign during WWII. They were a progression on the design of the [Sims Class](/History/SimsClass.md), includinig a heavier torpedo broadside of 10 tubes (versus 8), but far lighter than the 12 to 16 torpedo tube broadsides of the torpedo focused destroyer classes. Most Bensons spent the duration of the war with only a single quintuple torpedo mount in favor of heavier anti-aircraft armaments. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Bensons continued to serve in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres.

The ships were crewed by 276 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

The Benson class introduced several changes to the design principle. First, two stacks would adorn the spine of the ship, leading to an echeloned machinery arrangement. This arrangement featured alternating boiler and engine rooms. In theory, this setup would provide greater chances of survival should critical damage be sustained. At full load, these ships weighed roughly 2475 tons. Propulsion was supplied by 4 Babcock & Wilcox Oil Fired Express Broilers (containing a Super-heater and Economizer) powering 2 Bethlehem Steel Co. Impulse Reaction turbines. These, in turn, drove 2 shafts enabling the Benson class to reach up to 37.5 knots.
