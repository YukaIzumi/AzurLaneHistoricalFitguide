### Overview

Introduced in the mid 1910s, these ships marked the first battlecruisers constructed during the First World War for the Royal Navy. Unable to be completed as Revenge class, they were redesigned and finished as the unique Revenge class. These ships lasted through the Second World War and received multiple retrofits to augment their armament and sensor equipment.

The ships were crewed by 953 - 1223 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Under full load these ships weighed 36,660 tons. Armor consisted of a maximum thickness of 10 inches on the conning tower, 7-9 inches on the gun turrets, 4-7 on the barbettes, 3-6 in the belt, 304 on the bulkheads, and 1-2.5 inches on the deck. Propulsion was supplied by 42 Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers supplying power to two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines. These produced 112,000 shaft horsepower for three propellers. During speed trials, these ships reached up to 32.6 knots. <br/>
