### Overview

The Sims Class of Destroyers were introduced to the Fleet between 1939 and 1940. Their entry marked the last interwar series of destroyers built by the US Navy as, later in 1941, the US would enter the Second World War. All ships saw action in the war and were out-of-comission by 1946. These were the sixth series of destroyers built after construction resumed in the interwar period, the first being the [Farragut Class](/History/USN/FarragutClass.md). <br/>

The ships were crewed by 16 officers and 253 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Under the Second Washington Naval Treaty the Sims class were held to a tight standard of construction. This lead to the ships being only marginally larger than their predecessor and their grouping with the 1500 ton destroyers. At full load these ships weighed roughly 2293 tons. Propulsion was supplied by 3 Babcock & Wilcox Oil Fired Express Broilers (containing a Super-heater and Economizer) powering 2 Westinghouse E. & M. Co. Impulse Reaction Cross Compound geared turbines (with High Power Turbine for Cruising). These ships could reach up to 37 knots. The ships carried up to 53.11 tons of reserve feed water for the broilers, 36.89 tons of Diesel oil, and up to 451.39 Tons of Oil fuel.
