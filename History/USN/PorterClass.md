### Overview

An interwar design for a destroyer leader authorized in 1916, which was delayed considerably. These ships were constructed in response to the [Fubuki Class](/History/FubukiClass.md). They served through the duration of WWII in all theaters. The only loss was USS Porter in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

The ships were crewed by 13 officers and 290 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Propulsion was supplied by 4 Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving 2 geared steam turbines, for a total output of up to 50,000 shaft horsepower driving 2 shafts. These ships were capable of 37 knots and had a range of up to 6380 nautical miles.
