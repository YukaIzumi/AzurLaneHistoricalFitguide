### Overview

With 12 years since the last production of Destroyers under their belt, the Farragut class were a massive improvement over their predecessor, the Clemson class. All guns were now placed along the centerline, along with all torpedoes. The guns were upgraded from the smaller 4" barrels to the newer and more potent 5" rifles. Additionally, these ships had better sea-keeping capabilities, power hoist magazines, and an additional 450 nautical miles. However, these ships were somewhat top heavy, resulting in the loss of Hull and Monaghan to a typhoon in 1944. These destroyers saw their first bout of combat in the attack on Pearl Harbor, with all ships present. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor all ships were given an AA armament upgrade. Apart from Hull and Monaghan (lost to typhoon) or Worden (run aground in 1943), all other Farragut class members survived the war and were scrapped in 1946-1947. <br/>

The ships were crewed by 10 officers and 150-250 (peace/war) enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

The Farragut class displaced 1365 tons standard and 2064 tons on full load, with double the meta-centric height (resulting in far better stability). Propulsion was supplied by 4 Yarrow boilers powering 2 Parsons geared steam turbines. The boilers were the first instance of US destroyers using superheated steam. The turbines connected to two shafts (one each) and drove two propellers, granting up to 37 knots. These ships carried up to 78 tons of reserve feed water, 600 tons of fuel oil on full load, and 300 gallons of gasoline.
