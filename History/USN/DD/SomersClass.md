### Overview

Built to round out the 1850 ton standard displacement destroyers allotted by the London Naval Treaty, these ships were originally designed as a second generation of [Porter class](/History/USN/DD/PorterClass.md). Higher pressure boilers allowed for a single stack, reducing the weight of the ship and permitting a third centerline quadruple torpedo tube. These ships were top-heavy and overweight.

The ships were crewed by 10-16 officers and 225-278 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

This class was restricted by the London Naval Treaty. These ships displaced 1840 tons standard and 2767 tons under full load. Propulsion was supplied by 4 Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving 2 geared steam turbines, for a total output of up to 52,000 shaft horsepower driving 2 shafts. These ships were capable of 36 knots and had a range of up to 7020 nautical miles.
