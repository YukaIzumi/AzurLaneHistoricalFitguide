### Overview

Following up the design principles of the [Fubuki Class](/History/IJN/FubukiClass.md), the Hatsuharu class was designed to augment both the day and night operations of the Imperial Japanese Navy. These attacks were primarily torpedo attacks in which the ship would unload their torpedo broadside and retreat. Improvements to fire control systems and gun turrets allowed the main guns to be used as dual-purpose mountings against both sea and air targets. Unfortunately, most of the members of this class were overweight and top-heavy destoyers, leading to a redesign into the succeeding [Shiratsuyu Class](/History/IJN/ShiratsuyuClass.md), to the point where the Shiratsuyu class may be considered a continuation of the later Hatsuharu subclasses with a few improvements.  <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 212 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Limited by the London Naval Treaty, these ships had to fit within the assigned tonnage granted to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships displaced 1530 tons. Propulsion was supplied by 3 water-tube boilers driving 2 Kampon steam turbines for a total output of 42000 shaft horsepower. These ships could attain up to 36 knots of speed and travel 4000 nautical miles at 14 knots.
