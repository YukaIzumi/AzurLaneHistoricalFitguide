### Overview

Modified versions of the [Hatsuharu Class](History/IJN/HatsuharuClass.md), these ships were planned as part of the Hatsuharu class under the "Circle One" Naval Expansion Plan. The top-heavy nature of the previous class lead to a delay of those final 6 ships to undergo heavy modification and become the Shiratsuyu Class. An additional 4 members of this class were constructed under the "Circle Two" Naval Expansion Plan. These ships mounted the first quadruple torpedo mounts in the Japanese Navy and employed telephone communications to said stations. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 180 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Closely related to the Ariake sub-class of the Hatsuharu class, these ships were identical barring the bridge shape, funnel inclination, and armament. These ships displaced 1712 tons. Propulsion was supplied by 3 Kanpon boilers driving 2 shaft Kampon geared turbines for a total output of 42000 shaft horsepower. These ships could maintain 34 knots for a total cruising range of 4000 nautical miles at 18 knots.
