### Overview

In 1937 the Japanese government decided to allow the London Naval Treaty to expire, removing the obstacles blocking the modification and construction of newer, larger destroyers. 4 vessels of the Shiratsuyu class were cancelled and development immediately went into the Asashio class under the Maru-2 Supplementary Naval Expansion of 1934. These ships were the first Japanese destroyers to be equipped with sonar equipment on launch, and employed higher temperature boilers compared to their predecessors. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 200 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

These ships displaced 2408 tons. Propulsion was supplied by 3 Kanpon high-pressure steam boilers driving 2 shaft Kampon geared turbines, producing 50000 shaft horsepower. These ships could reach up to 35 knots and had a cruising range of 5700 nautical miles at a speed of 15 knots.
