### Overview

This class of ship were an improvement on the [Fubuki Class](/History/IJN/FubukiClass.md), wherein a new high-pressure boiler allowed fewer boilers to be fitted, which, in turn, allowed the fore smokestack to be narrower. These ships were among the first in the world to deploy a dual-purpose armament with their main guns reaching up to 75 degrees of vertical training. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 233 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

Similar to the Fubuki class, these ships displaced 1778 tons. Power was supplied by 3 high pressure steam boilers driving two shaft Kampon geared turbines, producing 50000 shaft horseppower. These ships were capable of up to 38 knots and had a cruising range of 5000 nautical miles at 14 knots.
