### Overview

Nearly an extension of the Kamikaze class, these ships served in similar secondary roles during the war, though they were still considered "front line" (early on) due to their range and torpedo armament. These ships were launched under different names, typically being a variant of 第X号駆逐艦 wherein "X" denotes the ship's number. IE Mutsuki, Dai-19 (第十九) would become 第十九号駆逐艦 (lit. Dai-Jū-Kyū-Gō Kuchikukan), No 19 Destroyer. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 154 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

These ships displaced 1336 tons standard and 1468 tons under full load. Power was supplied by 4 Ro-Gō Kampon water-tube boilers driving two shaft Kampon geared turbines, producing 38500 indicated horseppower. These ships were capable of up to 37.25 knots and had a cruising range of 3600 nautical miles at 14 knots.
