### Overview

An extention of the onging Minekaze class under the Eight-eight fleet plan, these late World War I era destroyers served under many secondary roles during the war. These ships were launched under different names, typically being a variant of 第X号駆逐艦 wherein "X" denotes the ship's number. IE Mutsuki, Dai-19 (第十九) would become 第十九号駆逐艦 (lit. Dai-Jū-Kyū-Gō Kuchikukan), No 19 Destroyer. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 152 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

These ships displaced 1400 tons standard and 1750 tons under full load. Power was supplied by 4 Ro-Gō Kampon water-tube boilers driving two shaft Kampon geared turbines, producing 38500 indicated horsepower. These ships were capable of up to 37.25 knots and had a cruising range of 3600 nautical miles at 14 knots.
