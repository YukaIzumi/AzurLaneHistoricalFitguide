### Overview

A class of experimental destroyers designed late in the war. These ships were a development on the previous Yūgumo class and Kagerō classes. The broadside of torpedoes was increased to 15 tubes, giving Shimakaze (and her class) the heaviest torpedo broadside of any single destroyer in the world. <br/>

The ships carried a complement of 267 men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

These ships displaced 2610 tons standard and 3400 tons under full load. 3 Kampon water-tube boilers powered 2 Kanpon impulse geared steam turbines, driving 2 shafts for a total output of 75000 shaft horsepower. These ships could reach up to 40.9 knots and had a cruising range of 6000 nautical miles at 18 knots.
