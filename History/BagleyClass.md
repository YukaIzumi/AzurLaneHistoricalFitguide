### Overview

A near-continuation of the Gridley Class, the as-built armament is nearly identical. The notable differences come in the form of an updated propulsion system allowing a longer cruising range at the cost of some speed.

The ships were crewed by 8 officers and 150-251 enlisted men. <br/>

### Hull and Propulsion

This class was restricted by the Second Washington Naval Treaty. These ships displaced 1624 tons standard and 2245 tons under full load. Propulsion was supplied by 4 Babcock & Wilcox boilers supplying 2 geared steam turbines, for a total output of 47,191 shaft horsepower. These ships were capable of 36.8 knots and had a cruising rnage of up to 6940 nautical miles.
