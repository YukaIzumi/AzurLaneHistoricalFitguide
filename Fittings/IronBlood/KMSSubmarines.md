# Submarines of the Kriegsmarine

## General Info

The submarines of Iron Blood represent the impact of the canceled Plan Z, a 1930's proposed re-armament of the German Navy. With few shipyards out of range of the Royal Air Force, Germany opted to construct hundreds of submarines to carry out stealth attacks, reconnaissance, and commerce raiding. When paired together these submarines put out some of the most consistent damage of any other nations submarine fleets. Use them tactically and experience great results.

* The G7a torpedo was widely used on Type VII and Type IX submarines up until around 1942 when it was surpassed by the G7e, a homing torpedo that produced no wake. Additionally, there is no single 8.8cm gun to use in their gun slot so I have approximated with the likely closest performer.

##### Alternative Auxiliary Equipment
* German submarines often used diesel generators to charge batteries during the night, which let them operate silently during the day.
