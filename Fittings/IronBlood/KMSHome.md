# Iron Blood / Kriegsmarine

Iron Blood represents the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) of World War II. This faction was introduced in the game's launch and has been growing ever since. This faction offers the strongest submarine fleets of any faction and a host of moderately-powerful battleships. Currently, Iron Blood has a low amount of ships so newer players might have a difficult time filling or equipping a full one or two fleets. The other ships are general purpose cruisers and destroyers with lower AA and slightly better gunpower than other nations.
