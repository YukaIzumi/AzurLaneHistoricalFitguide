# Destroyers of the Kriegsmarine

## General Info

The destroyers of Iron Blood were among the most numerous produced ship classes in the Kriegsmarine (barring Submarines), as they were quick to produce and could cover a variety of roles. While never reaching the full scope of operation as American or British destroyers, these destroyers still performed valiant work for the German Navy.

##### Additional Notes
* The Type 1936A destroyers were fitted with a variety of main armaments. The fit on launch typically used the 15cm guns in single mounts. Later fittings included the 15cm TbtsK in either a twin mount. Z23, Z24, Z25, and Z26 were fitted with the twin mount. Z28 was not. Most of the 1936A class also upgraded their 3.7cm SK C/30 twin mounts for faster firing 3.7cm Flak M42 mounts.

##### Additional Notes
* The Type 1936C destroyers were drafted up in late 1940 and ordered in 1941. Z46 and Z47 were laid down and later blown up in drydock, never reaching any notable stage of completion.
