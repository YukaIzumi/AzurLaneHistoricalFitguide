# Light Carriers of the Kriegsmarine

## General Info

The German Navy never was able to fully produce any aircraft carriers. Several reached the planning or conversion stage, with one or two even reaching levels near completion, but nothing ever sailed. In game, the Iron blood sports only a few, wherein each performs decently well.
