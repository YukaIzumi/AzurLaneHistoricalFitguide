# Fleet Carriers of the Royal Navy

## General Info

The fleet carriers of Royal Navy offer some of the heaviest torpedo strikes of any fleet carriers. Additionally, these carriers will typically also carry a heavier fighter armament and airspace denial capability than other nation's carriers. These carriers move from the battleship converted Eagle up to the purpose-built armored carriers of the Illustrious class.
