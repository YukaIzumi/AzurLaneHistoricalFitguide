# Light Carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy

## General Info

The light carriers of the Sakura Empire are support carriers to their core. The most potent healing carriers reside within the IJN, and the others are generally decent backline/fleet support. Aircraft are generally laid out in a 3/0/3 configuration, being 3 fighter aircraft, 0 dive bombers, and 3 torpedo bombers (with a few exceptions).

Many of these ships did not surive to the end of the war or were crippled by lack of industrial output, so additional fittings or equipment may be suggested below each historical fitting to predict what an end-of-war historical fitting would look like.
