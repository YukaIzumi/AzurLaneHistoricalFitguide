# Submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy

## General Info

The submarines of Eagle Union consist of the Gato class (4 members) and the Balao class (1 member). These submarines are fairly middle-of-the-pack when it comes to performance, but several of them offer skills that relate to notable kills during their career or to supporting other USN submarines in your fleet.
