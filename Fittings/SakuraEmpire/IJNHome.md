# Sakura Empire / Imperial Japanese Navy

The Sakura Empire represents the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. This faction was introduced in the game's launch and has been growing ever since. This faction boasts a collection of torpedo focused destroyers, light cruisers, and some heavy cruisers. Their battleships are among the best in the game and will remain serviceable in both PVP and PVE environments. Their aircraft carriers favor torpedo bombers over dive bombers. For hitting hard, getting hit hard, and fighting on, the Sakura Empire is your home.
