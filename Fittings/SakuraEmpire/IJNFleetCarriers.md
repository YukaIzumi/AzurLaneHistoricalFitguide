# Fleet Carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy

## General Info

The fleet carriers of Sakura Empire are among the heaviest single-target damage carriers in the game. They offer an aggressive 3/2/3 loadout, being 3 fighters, 2 dive bombers, and 3 torpedo bombers (in most cases). They offer a high aviation stat and the ability to apply massive pressure to a stationary or slow target.

Many of these ships did not surive to the end of the war or were crippled by lack of industrial output, so additional fittings or equipment may be suggested below each historical fitting to predict what an end-of-war historical fitting would look like.
