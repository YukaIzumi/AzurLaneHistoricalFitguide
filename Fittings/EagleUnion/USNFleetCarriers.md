# Fleet Carriers of the US Navy

## General Info

The fleet carriers of Eagle Union are among the heaviest hitters in the game. They offer a relatively balanced 3/3/2 loadout, being 3 fighters, 3 dive bombers, and 2 torpedo bombers (in most cases). They offer high aviation stats, high AA stats, and will often have skills to augment their strikes with additional planes or ordinance. The classes begin with the battlecruiser conversion Lexington class and end with the late-war Essex class.
