# Auxiliary Ships of the US Navy

## General Info

Only one auxilary ship exists in-game for Eagle Union, being USS Vestal. A converted collier, Vestal served through WWI, WWII, and had numerous interactions with ships like Enterprise, South Dakota, and Saratoga, among others. A fairly open fitting selection gives Vestal the ability to slow-tick heal allied ships or stack anti-aircraft auxiliary to augment her AA abilities.
