# Light Cruisers of the US Navy

## General Info

The light cruisers of the US Navy begin with the Omaha class and progress down the lineage toward the Cleveland class. The Seattle class is a fake ship design by Wargaming for World of Warships, but will be included in this list. Eagle Union light cruisers are split between ships wielding torpedoes and secondary guns. The secondary gun ships will gain a second main-gun mount in higher limit breaks, making them potent gunboats. The cruisers also typically boast a higher-than-average anti-aircraft armament and decent hitpoint pools. Some ship classes, like the Atlanta class, give up offensive armaments in order to better support your fleet in a dedicated anti-aircraft roll, and are vital components in end-game maps such as Worlds 12 and 13.

* Most of the Brooklyn class were built with the Quadruple 1.1in "Chicago Piano" on board as their medium-caliber anti-aircraft armament. As the war progressed and the demand for more potent anti-aircraft arose in the Pacific, ships were upgraded to wield the 40mm Bofors in multiple quadruple and twin mounts.

* The original armament of the Atlanta class depended on the quadruple 1.1in "Chicago Piano", but with the Oakland subclass, and similar requirements as the Brooklyn class, the switch was made to a mid-caliber armament of 40mm Bofors in twin mounts.
