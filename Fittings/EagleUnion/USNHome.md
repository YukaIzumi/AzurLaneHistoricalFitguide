# Eagle Union / United States Navy

The Eagle Union represents the US Navy of World War II. This faction was introduced in the game's launch and has been growing ever since. The faction boasts a collection general-purpose ships which typically excel in no particular category, but rather can be reliable in almost any. Members of the Eagle Union will usually have higher than average AA stats, destroyers and light cruisers will have lower torpedo stats, and aircraft carriers will generally exhibit a high level of air control and strike power due to their usage of dive bombers over torpedo bombers. The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver will be a great companion for your Essex class carriers.
