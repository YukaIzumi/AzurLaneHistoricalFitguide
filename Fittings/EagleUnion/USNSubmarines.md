# Submarines of the US Navy

## General Info

The submarines of Eagle Union consist of the Gato class (4 members) and the Balao class (1 member). These submarines are fairly middle-of-the-pack when it comes to performance, but several of them offer skills that relate to notable kills during their career or to supporting other USN submarines in your fleet.

* The Mk. 14 torpedo was the primary in-service torpedo for both surface and submerged craft of the US Navy. This torpedo was prone to failure and required a lengthy investigation by the US Navy before any improvements were made. Later fittings would have substituted the more reliable Mk. 16.
