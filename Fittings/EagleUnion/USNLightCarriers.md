# Light Carriers of the US Navy

## General Info

The light carriers of Eagle Union have deep roots. Starting with USS Langley, among the first naval aviation ships in the world, it progresses forward to the escort and light aircraft carriers of the Casablanca and Independence class, respectively. These ships are typically good force multipliers for your fleet, often having skills based around fighting alongside other CV/L/E. Their loadout usually consists of a 3/0/3, being 3 fighter aircraft, 0 dive bombers, and 3 torpedo bombers (with a few exceptions). They won't be the best for air superiority, but 3 fighters is close to standard for most carriers. The torpedo bombers will be parallel drops with these loadouts, so time them appropriately to get the most use.
