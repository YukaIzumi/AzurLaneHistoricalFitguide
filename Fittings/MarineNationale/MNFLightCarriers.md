# Light Carriers of the Marine Nationale

## General Info

While no large-scale carrier construction was ever deployed by France, there were a couple of notable carriers. French naval aviation was never significantly developed, relying mostly on very old French designed aircraft, or allied aircraft. With the bulk of France falling early in the war as well as a highly central location, France opted to rely on existing land-bases for any air operations instead of exerting an unnecessary blue-water fleet of carriers.

In game, the sole representative is Béarn, a Normandie class conversion. She has the unique option for carriers of equipping a secondary gun or a dive bomber.
