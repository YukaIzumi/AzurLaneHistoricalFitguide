# Destroyers of the Marine Nationale

## General Info

French-built destroyers follow a lineage of heavier, larger-caliber-armed, faster ships. Heavy guns weighed in at a sturdy 138.6mm on later craft, torpedoes a middling 550cm, and high-powered boilers and turbines, enabling among the fastest vessels to be constructed in WWII.

In game, the French destroyers are high speed, moderate evasion, high firepower gun-focused ships. Lower than average AA and torpedo statistics round them out to be less than a jack-of-all trades.
