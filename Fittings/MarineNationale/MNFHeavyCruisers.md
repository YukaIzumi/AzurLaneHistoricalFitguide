# Heavy Cruisers of the Marine Nationale

## General Info

French Heavy Cruisers were few in number. These ships were fairly standard, as far as CA go, to the point where many could argue that Algérie is among (if not) the best constructed treaty cruiser in existence.

In game, French heavy cruisers focus primarily on powerful HE damage and burn stacking.
