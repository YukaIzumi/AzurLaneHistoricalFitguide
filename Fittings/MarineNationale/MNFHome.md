# Iris Libre ; Vichya Dominion / Forces Navales Fran√ßaises Libres ; Marine Nationale

These two factions represent the split-forces of France during the Second World War. This faction hosts a series of high-gunpower ships with greater than average speed and lower torpedo and anti-aircraft capabilities. French battleships employ a unique pre-loaded battleship shot which will provide excellent up-front damage whenever desired. Additionally, the 138.6mm/50 Mle.1929 DD gun is still among the best HE destroyer guns for gun based DDs or FP hungry CL/As with powerful secondary armaments.
