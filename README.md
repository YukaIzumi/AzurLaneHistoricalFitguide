# AzurLaneHistoricalFitguide
A section of fittings for Azur Lane in which ship equipment is as true-to-life as possible.

## NOTICE

This project began a few months ago and has been migrated to this github repository. The old pages on the official wiki will be considered depricated and will no longer be updated as I no longer have access to them. The wiki pages ofor this project should be ignored as they cannot be considered reliable or up-to-date.

`## Foreword

`Azur Lane has been a game that has brought me entertainment since May of 2017, when the CN server first launched. I've played on that account almost daily since then, participated in the EN server closed beta, open beta, and launch, joined and left several discord servers of various quality, made a few edits and contributions to the main wiki, and started my own community to call home. But as with anything you do for years, it can become stale. The meta wasn't really changing. The same 12 ships or so were level 120 and only really seeing use in PvP or event hard modes. I had gear blueprints piling up, gold and oil piling up, and almost no desire to do anything beyond my daily 3 and pvp.

`So I changed how I played.

`I did some research, I looked up the history, and I compiled lists of each and every ship in the game, their class, modifications, special equipment or squadrons, and translated them across into Azur Lane. Each and every ship is fitted out with equipment that matches their real-life fitting as closely as possible. I still had my 120's for busting up a new map, but I found that even with this change in equipment I was still mostly competitive. World 11, 12, even 13, most PvP matches, even the siren mode up to corruption 5 (have yet to reach 6 as of writing).

`And it was fun. Azur Lane should be about having fun. If this seems fun to you, I invite you to try. Below is a list of all ship classes and their fittings. It's not a META tier list, it's not an equipment list. It's not even a hard and fast list of what to do and what not to do. If you're bored with AL or feel like mixing things up a little, give this a try.

### Historical Precedence 
For designing the historical fittings only  a few things were really taken into consideration.
* The at-launch fitting of a ship.
* Post-launch modifications.
* Potential equipment upgrades.
* Fleet technology or limitations.

Many ships underwent modifications as technology or equipment advanced. 
Older anti-air guns may have been upgraded to newer guns. Aircraft were exchanged for newer models. Azur Lane has a system to replicate this by consuming other ships to increase a ships stats, but fails to consider equipment changes. The equipment chosen will be the closest to a ship's real-life equipment as possible, with exceptions made for missing equipment (in the case of many nations using a 3" or 4" gun, for example), near identical equipment (21" torpedo mount vs. 21" Mk17 mount), or lack of any comparable equipment.

### Gameplay Note

`Azur Lane is a game that demands only a little from the player. What it does demand is a basic understanding of how your fleet works together for skills, buffs, and how to use equipment. As such there have been a few small bumps to ship potency here and there, as some gaps in equipment or equipment power are large enough to make a notable difference in ship performance. In many of these cases they also represent a finalized or planned refit of a ship (changing B5N to B6N, for example). This hopes to blend both historical accuracy as well as gameplay viability. This should make the game different, refreshing, or fun.

It should be duly noted that this is not a tier list, META list, or fitting guide on maximum performance for your ships. There are many other great resources for that. This collection of pages is for learning about ship fittings as they were built in life and trying them out in Azur Lane. I have personally cleared and 3* 13-4, 3* 11-4 hard mode, and cleared Siren Strongholds in Operation Siren using historical loadouts and faction themed fleets (all USN, HMS, etc.). They do work, it's just going to be a little different.
