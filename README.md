# AzurLaneHistoricalFitguide
A section of fittings for Azur Lane in which ship equipment is as true-to-life as possible.

## NOTICE

This project began a few months ago and has been migrated to this github repository. The old pages on the official wiki will be considered depricated and will no longer be updated as I no longer have access to them. The wiki pages ofor this project should be ignored as they cannot be considered reliable or up-to-date.

### Historical Precedence 
For designing the historical fittings only  a few things were really taken into consideration.
* The at-launch fitting of a ship.
* Post-launch modifications.
* Potential equipment upgrades.
* Fleet technology or limitations.

Many ships underwent modifications as technology or equipment advanced. 
Older anti-air guns may have been upgraded to newer guns. Aircraft were exchanged for newer models. Azur Lane has a system to replicate this by consuming other ships to increase a ships stats, but fails to consider equipment changes. The equipment chosen will be the closest to a ship's real-life equipment as possible, with exceptions made for missing equipment (in the case of many nations using a 3" or 4" gun, for example), near identical equipment (21" torpedo mount vs. 21" Mk17 mount), or lack of any comparable equipment.

### Gameplay Note

It should be duly noted that this is not a tier list, META list, or fitting guide on maximum performance for your ships. There are many other great resources for that. This collection of pages is for learning about ship fittings as they were built in life and trying them out in Azur Lane. I have personally cleared and 3* 13-4, 3* 11-4 hard mode, and cleared Siren Strongholds in Operation Siren using historical loadouts and faction themed fleets (all USN, HMS, etc.). They do work, it's just going to be a little different.
